# keywordize-json-body
This is expected to be added as Ring middleware that runs after ring.json.middleware/wrap-json-body. The wrap-json-body middleware does not convert map keys over to clojure based keywords. This middleware takes the result of wrap-json-body and converts the keys over to standard clojure based keywords.
